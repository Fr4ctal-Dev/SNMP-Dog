                        <h2>Introduction to SNMP</h2>
                        SNMP stands for simple network management protocol. It is a way that servers can share
                        information about
                        their current state, and also a channel through which an administer can modify pre-defined
                        values. While the protocol itself is very simple, the structure of programs that implement SNMP
                        can be very complex.
                        <br>
                        SNMP is a protocol that is implemented on the application layer of the networking stack. The
                        protocol was created as a way of gathering information from
                        very different systems in a consistent manner. Although it can be used in connection to a
                        diverse
                        array of systems, the method of querying information and the paths to the relevant information
                        are standardized.
                    </div>
                    <div class="pb-2 mb-3 border-bottom">
                        <h2 class="h2">Versions</h2>
                        There are multiple versions of the SNMP protocol, and many networked hardware devices implement
                        some form of SNMP access. The most widely used version is SNMPv1, but it is in many ways
                        insecure. Its popularity largely stems from its ubiquity and long time in the wild.
                        SNMPv2 was the second version of the protocol, which offers some substantial improvements on the
                        earlier standard. Included in this version was a new “party-based” security model meant to
                        address the security issues inherent with the prior revision. However, the new model was not
                        very popular because it was difficult to understand and implement.
                        <br><br>
                        Because of this, a few “spin-offs” of version 2 were created, each of which kept the bulk of the
                        version 2 improvements, but swapped out the security model. In SNMPv2c, community-based
                        authentication, the same model used in v1, was reintroduced.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1998, the third (and current) version of the SNMP protocol entered as a spec proposal. From a
                        user’s perspective, the most relevant change was the adoption of a user-based security system.
                        <br><br>
                        SNMP-Dog uses the current version of the SNMP protocol; v3.

                        <h2 class="h2">Agents and Managers</h2>
                        In general, a network being profiled by SNMP will mainly consist of devices containing SNMP
                        agents. An agent is a program that can gather information about a piece of hardware, organize it
                        into predefined entries, and respond to queries using the SNMP protocol.
                        <br>
                        SNMP agents do the bulk of the work. They are responsible for gathering information about the
                        local system and storing them in a format that can be queried.updating a database called the
                        “management information base”, or MIB.
                        <br><br>
                        The component of this model that queries agents for information is called an SNMP manager. These
                        machines generally have data about all of the SNMP-enabled devices in their network and can
                        issue requests to gather information and set certain properties.
                        <br>
                        The manager can be any machine that can send query requests to SNMP agents with the correct
                        credentials. Sometimes, this is implemented as part of a monitoring suite, while other times
                        this is an administrator using some simple utilities to craft a quick request.
                        <br><br>
                        SNMP-Dog is an SNMP manager.

                        <h2 class="h2">The MIB Structure</h2>
                        The most difficult part of the SNMP system to understand is probably the MIB, or management
                        information base. The MIB is a database that follows a standard that the manager and agents
                        adhere to. It is a hierarchical structure that, in many areas, is globally standardized, but
                        also flexible enough to allow vendor-specific additions.
                        <br><br>
                        The MIB structure is best understood as a top-down hierarchical tree. Each branch that forks off
                        is labeled with both an identifying number (starting with 1) and an identifying string that are
                        unique for that level of the hierarchy. You can use the strings and numbers interchangeably.
                        <br><br>
                        An example for a MIB is
                        <pre>HOST-RESOURCES-MIB</pre>
                        and an example for a MIB Value is
                        <pre>sysDescr</pre>
                        or its OID counterpart,
                        <pre>.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0</pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pb-2 mb-3 border-bottom">
                        <h2 class="h2">Tables</h2>
                        Sometimes, it makes sense to order MIB Values into tables to get easier access to larger amounts
                        of logically similar data quickly.
                        In this case a MIB Value points to a column of the table and the final integer of the OID can
                        (but doesn't have to) point to the row of that column, which allows us to get the actual
                        parameter we are looking for.
                        <br><br>
                        An example for this which the SNMP-Dog uses is the Storage Table. It makes sense for storage
                        media to be stored to be saved in tables because usually a PC has quite a few storage devices.
